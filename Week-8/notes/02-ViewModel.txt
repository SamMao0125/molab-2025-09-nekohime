Refactored `ContentView` to move all `@State` properties into an observable class.

## Changes Made:

1. Created `CatEarsViewModel` class using the `@Observable` macro to hold all state:
   - All color, size, and rotation properties
   - UI state (alerts, customization panel, recording)
   - Methods moved into the view model (`capturePhoto`, `toggleRecording`, `resetToDefaults`, `setupAlertNotifications`)

2. Updated `ContentView` to use the view model:
   - Single `@State` property for the view model instance
   - All bindings updated to use `viewModel.propertyName`
   - Methods called through the view model

3. Improved memory management:
   - Added `[weak self]` to the notification observer closure to prevent retain cycles

The code is cleaner and follows MVVM, separating view logic from state management. The `@Observable` macro automatically handles change tracking for SwiftUI views.

No lint errors found. The refactoring is complete and ready to use.

Added a subtle jiggle animation to the whiskers.

## Changes Made

1. Added `animateWhiskerJiggle()` in `ARFaceTrackingCoordinator.swift`:
   - Applies a continuous, subtle jiggle to each whisker
   - Each whisker has a slightly different amplitude, timing, and start delay for variation
   - Combines Y-axis (vertical) and Z-axis (horizontal) rotations for natural movement
   - Uses a 2.5-degree base amplitude with small per-whisker variation
   - Animation duration varies from 0.9–1.3 seconds per whisker

2. Updated `createWhiskersOnNode()` to start the animation when each whisker is created

3. Updated `recreateWhiskers()` to stop existing animations before removing whiskers to prevent conflicts

The jiggle is continuous, subtle, and slightly varied per whisker. The animations are removed when whiskers are recreated or updated.

Run the app; the whiskers should have a slight jiggle.

Investigating why the whiskers aren't animating. Reviewing the animation code:

Updating the animation: `rotateBy` might conflict with the base rotation. Switching to a direct `eulerAngles` approach using a custom action for smoother oscillation:


[2 tools called]

Fixing the animation: `customAction` resets `elapsedTime` on repeat, breaking continuity. Switching to a simpler, more reliable approach:


[2 tools called]

Using a simpler `rotateBy`-based oscillation. Verifying the animation starts and ensuring it's applied. Checking if we need to start it after the node is fully added:

Trying a different approach: using the renderer delegate to update whiskers each frame, since actions on AR-anchored nodes may not run. Alternatively, using a simpler, more direct animation method:


[2 tools called]

Using the `renderer(_:updateAtTime:for:)` delegate method to update whiskers each frame, since AR-anchored nodes may not reliably run actions:

Fixing an issue: we need to track each whisker's index. Updating the code to store the index with each whisker:


[4 tools called]

Fixing index tracking: each whisker needs a unique index across all whiskers, not per side. Updating the code:


[3 tools called]

Refactored the animation to use the `renderer(_:updateAtTime:)` delegate method, which is called every frame. This is more reliable for AR scenes than `SCNAction`.

## Changes Made:

1. **Switched to frame-by-frame animation**: Uses `renderer(_:updateAtTime:)` instead of `SCNAction`, which works better with AR-anchored nodes.
2. **Stores base rotations**: Each whisker's base rotation is stored when created, so jiggle is added on top.
3. **Time-based calculations**: Uses sine/cosine waves based on elapsed time to create smooth oscillation.
4. **Unique indices**: Each whisker (0–5) gets a unique index so they have different amplitudes and timing.
5. **Direct eulerAngles updates**: Updates `eulerAngles` every frame, which is reliable for AR.

The whiskers should now jiggle continuously with slight per-whisker variation. The animation updates every frame based on time, so it should be visible.

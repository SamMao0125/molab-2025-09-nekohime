Added cat whiskers to the AR face tracking app.

## Changes Made:

1. **CatEarsViewModel** — Added whisker properties:
   - `whiskerColor` (default: gray)
   - `whiskerLength` (default: 0.03)
   - `whiskerThickness` (default: 0.0008)

2. **ARFaceTrackingView** — Added bindings to pass whisker parameters to the coordinator

3. **ARFaceTrackingCoordinator** — Implemented whisker rendering:
   - Creates 6 whiskers (3 per cheek)
   - Positions them on the cheeks, extending outward
   - Updates whiskers when parameters change
   - Uses cylindrical geometry with customizable color, length, and thickness

4. **ContentView** — Updated to pass whisker bindings to the AR view

The whiskers appear automatically when face tracking is active. They’re positioned on the cheeks and extend horizontally outward, matching the face’s movement. Defaults are applied; customization can be added to the panel if needed.

No linter errors found. Ready to test.
Investigating why whiskers aren't showing and why customization controls are missing. Reviewing the customization panel and AR implementation.

Fixing whisker rotation: cylinders extend along the Y axis by default, so rotate around the Z axis to make them horizontal:


[4 tools called]

## Changes Made:

1. **Added Whisker Controls to Customization Panel**:
   - Created `WhiskerSectionView` in `EarCustomizationSections.swift`
   - Added whisker color picker, length slider, and thickness slider
   - Updated `CustomizationPanelView` to include the whisker section
   - Updated `ContentView` to pass whisker bindings to the customization panel

2. **Fixed Whisker Visibility**:
   - Increased default thickness from `0.0008` to `0.0015`
   - Increased default length from `0.03` to `0.04`
   - Adjusted positioning to be on the cheeks (Y around 0.0, Z at 0.03)
   - Fixed rotation: cylinders extend along the Y axis by default, so rotate around the Z axis to make them horizontal:
     - Left whiskers: rotate -90° around Z (extends in -X)
     - Right whiskers: rotate +90° around Z (extends in +X)

The whiskers should now:
- Appear in the AR view on the cheeks when face tracking is active
- Be customizable through the customization panel with color, length, and thickness controls
- Be more visible with the increased default thickness

Test the app; the whiskers should appear on both cheeks when the face is detected, and you can customize them using the controls in the customization panel.

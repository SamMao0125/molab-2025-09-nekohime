Further refactoring of `ContentView.swift` is complete. Here's what changed:

## New files created

1. **`CameraControlsView.swift`** (31 lines)
   - Photo and video button controls
   - Handles button actions via closures

2. **`CustomizationPanelView.swift`** (75 lines)
   - Main customization panel container
   - Toggle button and panel visibility
   - Composes section views

3. **`EarCustomizationSections.swift`** (124 lines)
   - **`ColorSectionView`** — color pickers for outer/inner ear colors
   - **`SizeShapeSectionView`** — sliders for height, width, and thickness
   - **`RotationSectionView`** — sliders for rotation angles

## Improvements

- **ContentView.swift reduced from 288 to 121 lines** (58% reduction)
- **Separation of concerns**: Each component has a single responsibility
- **Reusability**: Section views can be reused or modified independently
- **Readability**: ContentView now shows the high-level layout structure
- **Maintainability**: Changes to individual sections are isolated

## Final file structure

```
ContentView.swift              - Main view (121 lines)
├── CameraControlsView.swift   - Camera buttons
├── CustomizationPanelView.swift - Panel container
├── EarCustomizationSections.swift - Section components
├── ARFaceTrackingView.swift   - AR view wrapper
├── ARFaceTrackingCoordinator.swift - AR logic
└── Color+Extension.swift      - Color utilities
```

All files compile with no linting errors. The codebase is now more modular and maintainable.

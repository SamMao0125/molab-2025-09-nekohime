create folder View and move all view related files into it, except for ContentView

Checking which Swift files are view-related. Then we'll create the `View` folder and move them, excluding `ContentView.swift`.

Checking a few files to confirm they're view files, then creating the `View` folder and moving them.

Creating the `View` folder and moving the view files (excluding `ContentView`). Keeping `Color+Extension.swift` at the root since it's an extension, not a view.

cd "/Users/jht2/Documents/projects/_moLab/students/molab-2025-09-nekohime/Week-8/CatEarsFilter" && mkdir -p View

cd "/Users/jht2/Documents/projects/_moLab/students/molab-2025-09-nekohime/Week-8/CatEarsFilter" && mv ARFaceTrackingView.swift CameraControlsView.swift CustomizationPanelView.swift EarCustomizationSections.swift View/

Updating the Xcode project file to reflect the new file paths:

This project uses `PBXFileSystemSynchronizedRootGroup`, so Xcode should automatically detect the new folder structure. Verifying the files were moved correctly:

Files moved correctly. Summary:

✅ **Created `View` folder** in `/CatEarsFilter/`
✅ **Moved view files**:
   - `ARFaceTrackingView.swift`
   - `CameraControlsView.swift`
   - `CustomizationPanelView.swift`
   - `EarCustomizationSections.swift`
✅ **Left `ContentView.swift`** in the main directory (as requested)

Since this project uses `PBXFileSystemSynchronizedRootGroup`, Xcode will automatically detect the new folder structure when you open the project. No manual project file updates are needed.

Swift files in the same module can reference each other without explicit paths, so `ContentView.swift` will still find the views in the `View` folder without any import changes. The code should compile and run correctly.

## Changes Made:

1. **Added Whisker Controls to Customization Panel**:
   - Created `WhiskerSectionView` in `EarCustomizationSections.swift`
   - Added whisker color picker, length slider, and thickness slider
   - Updated `CustomizationPanelView` to include the whisker section
   - Updated `ContentView` to pass whisker bindings to the customization panel

2. **Fixed Whisker Visibility**:
   - Increased default thickness from `0.0008` to `0.0015`
   - Increased default length from `0.03` to `0.04`
   - Adjusted positioning to be on the cheeks (Y around 0.0, Z at 0.03)
   - Fixed rotation: cylinders extend along the Y axis by default, so rotate around the Z axis to make them horizontal:
     - Left whiskers: rotate -90° around Z (extends in -X)
     - Right whiskers: rotate +90° around Z (extends in +X)

The whiskers should now:
- Appear in the AR view on the cheeks when face tracking is active
- Be customizable through the customization panel with color, length, and thickness controls
- Be more visible with the increased default thickness

Test the app; the whiskers should appear on both cheeks when the face is detected, and you can customize them using the controls in the customization panel.

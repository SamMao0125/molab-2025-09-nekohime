## Summary

✅ **Created `ARCaptureManager.swift`** — a new file containing all photo and video capture functionality, including:
- Photo capture methods
- Video recording (start, stop, frame capture)
- Pixel buffer conversion utilities
- Video saving to photo library
- Notification handling for capture events

✅ **Refactored `ARFaceTrackingCoordinator.swift`** — removed all capture-related code:
- Removed video recording properties and methods
- Removed photo capture methods
- Removed notification observers for capture events
- Added a `captureManager` property that automatically receives the `sceneView` reference

✅ **Integration** — `ARFaceTrackingCoordinator` now uses an `ARCaptureManager` instance. When the `sceneView` is set, it’s passed to the capture manager via a `didSet` observer.

The code compiles without errors, and functionality is preserved. The separation improves maintainability: `ARFaceTrackingCoordinator` handles AR face tracking and rendering, while `ARCaptureManager` handles all capture operations.

**Note:** If the new file doesn’t appear in Xcode, add it to your Xcode project manually or let Xcode auto-discover it when you build.

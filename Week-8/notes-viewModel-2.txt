No lint errors. Ensuring `ARFaceTrackingView` reacts to viewModel changes. Since `UIViewRepresentable` doesn't automatically observe `@Observable`, verifying the implementation is correct:

## Refactoring Summary

### 1. **ARFaceTrackingView**
- Replaced multiple `@Binding` parameters with a single `viewModel: CatEarsViewModel` parameter
- Updated `updateUIView` to read properties directly from the viewModel

### 2. **CustomizationPanelView**
- Replaced multiple `@Binding` parameters and the `onReset` closure with a single `viewModel: CatEarsViewModel` parameter
- Created `Binding` instances from viewModel properties for the section views (which still use `@Binding`)
- Updated references to use `viewModel.showCustomization` and `viewModel.resetToDefaults()`

### 3. **ContentView**
- Updated to pass the `viewModel` directly to both views
- Simplified from multiple bindings to `ARFaceTrackingView(viewModel: viewModel)` and `CustomizationPanelView(viewModel: viewModel)`

The code now follows MVVM more closely: both views receive the viewModel instead of individual bindings, improving maintainability and reducing parameter count. Since `CatEarsViewModel` uses the `@Observable` macro, SwiftUI tracks changes and updates the views when viewModel properties change.

No lint errors detected. The refactoring is ready to use.
